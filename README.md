## Project Description üìù
The instruction set of a single-cycle MIPS processor in HDL comprises a limited subset of the MIPS instruction set. This project aims to enhance the single-cycle MIPS processor design to accommodate a broader range of instructions. The added instructions include: 

1. Normal instructions
   - sll
   - sb
3. Pseudo-instructions
   - ble
   - li
5. Custom instruction
   -zero-from-right (zfr)
